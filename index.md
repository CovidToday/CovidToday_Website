* `rt_` : Reproduction number 
* `cfr1_` : Crude case fatality rate or Na√Øve CFR [Deaths/Total Cases]
* `cfr2_` : Outcome adjusted fatality rate [Deaths/(Recov+Deaths)] - maybe more meaningful because it excludes active cases with yet unknown outcome

Replaced by the outcome adjusted fatality rate on the dashboard from 31 August 2020, however this metric is still available in the datasets.
